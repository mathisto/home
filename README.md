Spent the better part of a week tearing up and down multiple linux/macos setups before hobbling together a very crap version of [THESE DROP DEAD GORGEOUS DOTS](https://github.com/itaysharir/Dotfiles).

Thanks to Johnny for guiding me to keep the dots in a repo.

Next up. Kmonad and its replacement of or interface with skhd.

Dots being maintained by [yadm](https://yadm.io/)
